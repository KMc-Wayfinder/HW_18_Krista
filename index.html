        <h1>Krista McNaney</h1>
        <p>My name is Krista McNaney and I am a design advocate and double diamond UX/UI designer 
          with strong visual instincts. My fervent desire is to use my UX/UI skills and my background 
          in graphics to work with you creating attractive, user-centric designs. 
          My story starts in Northern Ontario where I was born and raised. The small town I come from 
          isnâ€™t very far from where Letterkenny is filmed. I made my way down south and graduated from 
          Niagara College with a degree in Graphic Design.

          From there my path led me through various print factories, newspapers, 
          magazines and print shops throughout Ontario. I honed my skills, developed new 
          ones and gained experience in many different fascets 
          of the print industry.
          
          Always eager to learn a new skill, I decided to curve my career towards user 
          experience design as UX lets both sides of my brain frolic while I solve puzzles 
          to help create visually appealing, user-centric designs.
          
          So here I am, ready to help you with your UX needs.</p>
